# üöÄ LNbits MCP Server - Quick Start

## ‚úÖ Server Status: READY TO USE!

The LNbits MCP server has been successfully installed and tested.

## üîå How to Connect

### Step 1: Get Your LNbits Credentials

1. **Open your LNbits instance** (e.g., `https://your-lnbits-instance.com`)
2. **In the sidebar, expand the "Node URL, API keys and API docs" section.
4. **Copy your Admin or Invoice/readonly API key** (Admin key for full access, e.g. paying invoices etc., Invoice key for read-only e.g. creating invoices, checking wallet balance, etc.)

### Step 2: Connect to your LLM client

#### Example: Claude Desktop

1. **Find your Claude Desktop config file:**
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Add this configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lnbits": {
      "command": "/Users/[username]/Desktop/lnbits-mcp-server/venv/bin/lnbits-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Open or restart your LLM client**

### Step 3: Test the Connection

First you need to configure your LLM client to use the LNbits MCP server. Do this with a command like:

```
Configure lnbits.

URL: https://demo.lnbits.com
Key: [your api key]
Auth method: api_key_header
```

In your LLM client, you can now use commands like:
- "Check my LNbits wallet balance"
- "Get my recent payments"
- "Create an invoice for 1000 sats"
- "Pay this lightning invoice: lnbc..."
